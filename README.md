Bank Management System(BMS0

**Overview of the Project**

A BMS is basically an integrated enterprise-wide information system that does not rely on manual paper-based processes for data maintenance, thus providing a secure and efficient interface, friendly to end-users--both bank personnel and customers.

**Features**

The system executes the following major banking activities:

Account Creation (Create_account): This shall allow the new user to be created, including the details required to open the account, generate a unique account number, and persistently store it in a file or simple database.

Deposit Funds: Deposit_amount-This allows a user to deposit funds into an already existing account number, upon proper verification of the account number.

Withdraw Amount: This will allow the user to draw funds from an account. It includes the logic to check for minimum balance and adequate funds.

display_account - Displays Account Details: This fetches and then presents the current balance and account information for any given account number.

Delete Account: This will irreversibly remove an account from the system once confirmed.

Main Menu - main.py: This contains a simple, interactive, console-based menu to navigate through major functionalities.
