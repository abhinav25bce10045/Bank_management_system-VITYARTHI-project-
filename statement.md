2. Transaction Processing:- Support two major update operations: deposit and withdrawal of funds.

3. Data Retrieval: Ability to query for and display account details with current balance.

Target user

Students/Learners: Those learning the Python language or software development generally and interested in understanding modular design and how to handle data in a 
program.

Instructors/Evaluators: For quick demonstration and evaluation of the following basic programming concepts: modularity, error handling, basic I/O.

**High-level features**

Modular Design: The code is segregated into various packages for different operations. The packages include Create_account, Deposit_amount, Withdraw_amount,
